# Reflection
I have learned regarding integrity and anti-corruption, includes concept and importance of integrity, concept of corruption, ways to prevent ourselves from involving in anti-corruption, and many more. I also learned more cases regarding corruption through the assessment of making poster in this course. I value integrity more and always remind myself not to act against integrity.  
I think it would be better if the course could be conducted in a more interesting way so that we could immerse ourselves more into it.
